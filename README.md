# OneShotUtil-V1.5
Simple utility for speedrunning OneShot. Some code from hunternet93 and Firestrike's OneShot utilities used in this one.
Able to read you your safe code, and set your save to eight different locations, through both the Any% and NG+ routes.
Will check for safe code in the default Documents location, a OneDrive-altered location, and failing both, will allow you to enter a custom route to the safe code document, saved to a .ini file.
If the path is entered incorrectly, the .ini file can easily be edited and the route changed.

EXE downloadable here, will likely be detected as a virus by most antivirus software due to issues with pyInstaller.
